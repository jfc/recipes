Room Temperature Chickpea Barley Salad
------------------------------------------------------
2 large romaine leaves
3 large stems broccoli, with stem
1 large tomato
2 handfuls barley
3 handfuls chickpeas
1/2 cup Newman's Olive Oil salad dressing
1 oz cream cheese

Cover barley with plenty of water, add salt. Cook 15 minutes in pressure
cooker. Relieve pressure, add chickpeas, olive oil, cook another 25 minutes
under pressure. Drain.

Build salad into 2 large salad bowls (or plates). First tear romaine leaves
into bite-size piece and line bottom. Cut broccoli stems thinly, and florets
into bite-size pieces. Place into each bowl. Cut tomato into half-inch cubes
and divide between bowls. Spread barley  and chickpeas into each bowl. Place
cream cheese in a bowl and whisk in the salad dressing, starting with about an
ounce to achieve an emulsion. Spoon dressing mixture on each salad. Grate
pecorino romano on top. Add green onion. Add walnuts. Add tabasco.
